 <h2> In this 1st quarter of ICT subject, I learned many new ways to code and program different things, like tables, lists, and forms. Different coding techniques were also discussed, which were XHTML and CSS. With this information, I was able to make this complex but simple code for my E-Portfolio in ICT 9. However, I only did this a few days before the due date, I was able to make a website that showcases each lesson in ICT discussed. This was a very difficult and long task, especially under pressure. That’s why I learned to lessen cramming projects and do this at an earlier time little by little.</h2>
